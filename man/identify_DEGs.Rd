\title{Title: Identify Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)
Description: This function performs differential expression analysis on RNA-seq count data using the edgeR package.
It identifies genes that are differentially expressed based on specified thresholds for FDR and logFC.}
\usage{
identify_DEGs(
  count_data,
  group_labels,
  fdr_threshold = 0.05,
  logFC_threshold = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{count_data}{A matrix or data frame containing the RNA-seq count data, where rows represent genes and columns represent samples.}

\item{group_labels}{A vector indicating the group labels for each sample (e.g., control vs treatment).}

\item{fdr_threshold}{A numeric value representing the false discovery rate threshold. Default is 0.05.}

\item{logFC_threshold}{A numeric value representing the log-fold change threshold. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with associated statistics like FDR and logFC.
